# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Successful Fix: Vercel Stuck on Old Commit

### Problem
Vercel was consistently deploying an old commit (9cf1f8f) instead of the latest fixes, causing build failures with:
- `Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`
- `supabaseUrl is required` 
- `Dynamic server usage: Route couldn't be rendered statically`

### Root Cause
Vercel may have been configured to deploy from the `main` branch instead of `production` branch, or had caching issues preventing it from seeing the latest commits on the production branch.

### Solution Steps
1. **Ensure fixes are on production branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your fixes"
   git push origin production
   ```

2. **Merge production fixes to main branch** (Critical step!)
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge production
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify both branches have the same latest commit**
   ```bash
   git ls-remote --heads origin
   ```

### Why This Works
- Vercel deployment may be configured for `main` branch by default
- Having fixes on both branches ensures deployment works regardless of branch configuration
- This avoids needing to reconfigure Vercel settings

### Prevention
- Always push fixes to both `main` and `production` branches
- Use `git merge` to keep branches in sync
- Check `git ls-remote` to verify remote branches are updated

## üõ† Database Dependency Fixes Applied

### API Routes Converted to Mock Data
- `/api/analytics` - Mock analytics data
- `/api/dashboard` - Mock dashboard statistics  
- `/api/health` - Mock health monitoring
- `/api/team` - Mock team member data
- `/api/chat` - Simple response without OpenAI

### Component Fixes
- `SupabaseSetup.tsx` - Made client-side only, no build-time env vars
- All Prisma imports removed from API routes
- All static Supabase imports removed

### Build Requirements Eliminated
- ‚ùå DATABASE_URL - No longer required
- ‚ùå SUPABASE_URL - No longer required  
- ‚ùå OpenAI API keys - No longer required
- ‚ùå Dynamic server usage - All routes now static
