## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 minutes)

### Option 1: Automatic Setup Script
```bash
# Run the setup helper
./setup-supabase-env.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create account + new project (free tier is fine)
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for setup

2. **Get Credentials**
   - In Supabase: **Settings → API**
   - Copy: **Project URL** and **anon public key**

3. **Update Environment**
   - Edit `.env.local`
   - Replace the placeholder values:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...your-actual-key
   ```

4. **Create Database Table**
   - In Supabase: **SQL Editor → New Query**
   - Copy/paste the SQL from **Settings → Supabase** in your dashboard
   - Click **Run**

5. **Test & Sync**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Restart server
   node scripts/quick-sync.js  # Sync your team data
   ```

## 🔧 Where to Find Everything

### In Your Dashboard:
- **Settings → Supabase** - Complete setup guide with copy/paste SQL
- **Debug Panel** - Purple database icon (bottom-right) for real-time monitoring
- **Dashboard** - Live stats now show real data from your team

### Files Added:
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client and utilities
- `components/SupabaseSetup.tsx` - Interactive setup guide
- `components/DebugPanel.tsx` - Real-time monitoring panel
- `scripts/quick-sync.js` - Fast data sync utility
- `setup-supabase-env.sh` - Automated environment setup

## 🤝 How to Collaborate with Claude

### Option 1: Share Project Access (Recommended)
1. In Supabase: **Settings → API → Project API keys**
2. Share your **Project URL** and **anon key** with Claude
3. Claude can then:
   - Query your data in real-time
   - Help debug issues with live data
   - Suggest optimizations based on actual usage
   - Monitor changes during development

### Option 2: Export/Import Data
1. Use the debug panel to export current stats
2. Run SQL queries in Supabase and share results
3. Export team data as JSON for analysis

### Example Collaboration Session:
```
You: "Claude, I'm having issues with team member ratings not updating"

Claude: "I can help debug this. Can you share your Supabase credentials so I can check the data directly?"

You: [shares credentials]

Claude: [runs queries] "I see the issue - the overall_rating field is being updated but the frontend cache isn't refreshing. Let me check the API endpoint..."
```

## 🔍 Debug Panel Features

The purple database icon gives you:

### Live Statistics
- **Team Members**: Real count from database
- **Tasks**: Active and completed counts
- **Projects**: Current project status
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of latest refresh

### Real-time Activity Feed
- See database changes as they happen
- Monitor team member additions/updates
- Track task creation and completion
- View recent modifications with timestamps

### Connection Status
- ✅ **Connected & Monitoring** - Supabase working properly
- ⚠️ **Not Configured** - Need to add credentials
- ❌ **Connection Error** - Check credentials/internet

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### "Not Configured" in Debug Panel
- Check `.env.local` has correct Supabase URL and key
- Restart development server: `npm run dev`
- Verify credentials in Supabase dashboard

### "Table not found" Error
- Create the users table using SQL from Settings → Supabase
- Ensure SQL was executed successfully in Supabase
- Check table exists in Supabase → Table Editor

### No Real-time Updates
- Verify real-time is enabled: `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.users;`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure Supabase project isn't paused (free tier limitation)

### Sync Script Issues
```bash
# Check if team data exists
node scripts/quick-sync.js

# Force full sync
node scripts/sync-to-supabase.js
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Anon keys** are safe to use in frontend code
- **Service role keys** should only be used server-side
- Enable **Row Level Security** for production use
- Never commit credentials to git (they're in `.env.local`)

## 🎯 Benefits for Development

### Immediate Benefits:
- **Live team count** (no more mock data showing 12 when you have 20)
- **Real task statistics** based on actual data
- **Department performance** charts with real numbers
- **Debug panel** for instant database insights

### For Debugging with Claude:
- **Shared database access** for collaborative problem-solving
- **Real-time monitoring** during development sessions
- **Query assistance** with actual data
- **Performance analysis** on real usage patterns
- **Data migration** and sync support
